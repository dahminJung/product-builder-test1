# Simplified Lotto Number Generator Blueprint

## Overview
A simplified, easy-to-use web application that generates random Lotto numbers. It focuses on clarity and immediate utility.

## Features
- **One-Click Generation:** A single button to get 6 unique numbers (1-45).
- **Clear Display:** Large, easy-to-read numbers.
- **Minimalist Design:** Clean aesthetic without unnecessary complexity.

## Current Plan: Simplification
1.  **Refactor `index.html`:** Remove history and secondary buttons for a cleaner layout.
2.  **Refactor `style.css`:** Simplify the styling, focusing on the numbers and the main action button.
3.  **Refactor `main.js`:** Streamline the code to only handle the number generation and display.
